            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome back to blog post 2! Today I will be sharing something I have learned in class, fashion!
                As we covered in class, fast fashion is among the most current topics of how globalization has
                fundamentally changed consumer industry. Companies quickly create large quantities of stylish,
                affordable clothing; which results in growth in a globalized economy. Customers may easily
                acquire the newest trends with this approach to fashion. As it releases new collections in weeks
                rather than months and satisfies the desire for reasonably priced. This quick cycle has been the
                foundation of the business models of companies like Zara, H&M, and Shein, generating
                enormous profits and an ongoing flow of new goods (Cachon & Swinney, 2011; Tokatli, 2008) </p>

        <article>
            <h2>The Human Cost </h2>
            <p>Global supply chains in which components are obtained from one region, constructed in another,
                and marketed globally. The foundation of global fast fashion firms such as Zara, H&M, and
                Shein. To meet consumer demand, these companies consistently produce stylish, reasonably
                priced goods. However, their low pricing frequently conceals the abuse of workers in countries
                like Bangladesh, India, and Vietnam. Ethical concerns about global labor standards and the fair
                treatment of workers exist because clothing workers in these countries are frequently paid less
                than living wages. Work in hazardous circumstances, and lack fundamental labor rights (Tokatli,
                2008). We discovered that the phrase "race to the bottom" refers to the battle between nations to
                provide the lowest prices, frequently at the expense of the welfare of their workforce.</p>

        <article>
            <h2>Environmental Impact </h2>
            <p>Fast fashion has a significant negative influence on the environment. Research indicates that
                every year, millions of tons of fabric waste wind up in landfills due to the quick changes in
                fashion. Furthermore, the production of textiles requires a lot of water and harmful dyes, which
                pollutes water supplies and depletes resources in nations with lax or nonexistent environmental
                laws (Bick, Halsey, & Ekenga, 2018). This environmental cost serves as a reminder of one of the
                drawbacks of globalization: the preference for financial gain over ecological sustainability. The
                world is further harmed by these materials because they are not recyclable and can take hundreds
                of years to break down.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h2>Connections </h2>
            <p>We talked about potential remedies in class, like heightened consumer awareness and legislative
                frameworks that support sustainable behaviors. As buyers, we should make better moral
                decisions if we are aware of the sources and effects of the clothes we buy. As customers we can
                go with alternatives to fast fashion or shopping, that leads to less harm an example, a thrift store.
                Companies which support and value ethical labor practices and environmental responsibility and
                prioritize quality over quantity I encourage you to examine your own buying habits and think
                about how they may fit into more environmentally friendly practices.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h2>Globalized World </h2>
            <p>Fast fashion serves as an example of the complexities of a global consumer culture where ethics
                are frequently assigned to business. We can now afford fashion thanks to globalization! But it
                has also created a system were ecosystems and vulnerable communities. Restructuring the
                fashion industry toward a more sustainable and equitable model can be achieved. Share your
                information with friends and family to help spread the word. We can all have a greater impact if
                more people are aware of the true consequences of rapid fashion. Your decisions have the power
                to improve the future of our world and its inhabitants. Let us work toward a fashion industry that
                prioritizes ethics and sustainability before financial gain.
